# Little_Secrets

In this project I created a website which will tell the little secrets of yourself .
To run this file you will have to open terminal in your IDE or system then you will have to go in the repo if the project .
After that you will have to download node.js for that you will have to open index.js file in your terminal then write a command npm i.
npm i will download the node module .

After that you can say nodemon index.js to host this website after that you see the website on your browser on localhost:3000.

Then apply the changes add new module how you like it .

All the best !!!!
